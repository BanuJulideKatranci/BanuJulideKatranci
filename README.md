👋 Hi there! I’m @BanuJulideKatranci, an Industrial Engineering senior student with a knack for making things run smoother. 🚀  
📊 I’m all about Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Process Optimization—basically turning chaos into order, one dataset at a time!  
🌱 Currently leveling up my skills in data analytics and machine learning, and always on the lookout for cool new ways to apply them in the real world.  
💼 I’ve had some fun stints at places like Pegasus Airlines (Ekip Planlama & İş Geliştirme) and even İstanbul Ticaret Odası (Project Management & Business Development) 
💻 While I'm not a full-time coder, I do enjoy getting my hands dirty with some code, especially when it helps me analyze data or automate boring tasks!  
💞️ I’m looking to team up on projects that mix industrial engineering with some data magic. If you’ve got something that needs optimizing, I’m your person!  
🌍 Outside of work, you’ll find me volunteering with organizations because making a difference matters to me.  
📫 Let’s connect! Find me on [(https://www.linkedin.com/in/banu-jülide-katrancı-a6a490218/)) or shoot me an email at banujulidekatranci@gmail.com. I’m always down for a chat or collaboration.
